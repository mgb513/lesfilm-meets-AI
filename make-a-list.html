									<h2>Make a List of 50 Lesbian Films</h2>
									<p>How the point of departure became the point of departure</p>
								</header>

								<p>
									When deciding on the terminology to use in my GenAI queries, I settled on working with the term "Lesbian" rather than "wlw" (women loving women), "gay," or "queer." Although these terms overlap, and I've used all of them to describe my own identity, I felt that "Lesbian" would narrow and specify the scope of my inquiry most clearly and elicit outputs that hint at the prevalence of "Lesbian" as a label for GenAI training data. Working with the term "Lesbian" also gives me a chance to track the term's occurrence in AI-generated text, including in descriptions of AI-generated images.
								</p>

								<p>
									I am approaching this project from my position as an avid consumer and middle-aged fan of popular lesbian films. As is true for many queer people, representation in culture has been more than simply sought after. I have craved and loved and loathed it. Even before I knew a way to describe my way of being in the world, I was longing for stories that would trace my curiosities, and help me discover and articulate my existence as a queer woman growing up in a restrictive culture – Austria, small town, Catholicism, 1980s. Through stories, I also hoped for insight into the variety of experiences and bodies that all claim belonging in the queer portion of the intersectional Venn identity diagram. 
								</p>

								<p>
									However, in the culture consumption of my teenage years, I have no memory of encountering queer renderings or perspectives, and my understanding of Lesbians was decidedly that of two women performing physical entanglement for the benefit of men (some of whom were, at the time obsessed with a VHS copy of the film "Bilitis") and not something I could consider a descriptor of parts of myself. And, so, when I finally did have access to stories about (and by) queer women on TV and in film, when I moved to NY in the 1990s, and when the internet made access to message boards and fan culture possible, my queer and specifically lesbian culture consumption regularly included film and TV criticism, comment sections of fan forums and at times fan art and fan fiction. 
								</p>

								<p>
									Creating representation was and is a high-stakes responsibility for creators, and the ability of viewers to talk back to creators (esp. in the world of television) hastened confrontations about accountability and the harms of pernicious tropes, like "bury your gays" which refers to the (even in 2016 still astonishingly high) death rate of wlw characters in TV representation (Waggoner).

										<h2>About This Project</h2>
									</header>
									<p>
										This project investigates how generative AI systems assemble, filter, and represent film data—specifically examining lesbian cinema as a case study. Through auditing GenAI outputs across multiple dimensions (text, images, metadata), we explore what gets included, excluded, and transformed in the process.
