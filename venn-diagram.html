									<h2>A Venn Diagram</h2>
									<p>GenAI & Lesbian Representation & Fanfiction</p>
								</header>

								<p>
									Since I see this project as an investigation of representations of representations, looking at fan fiction and fan art and their intersection with GenAI can serve as an informative starting point. There is no shortage of AI-generated lesbian fan art and fan fiction. A simple Google search will provide a plethora of examples and GenAI tools, including prompting advice for users. That same Google search will also reveal an ongoing debate about the acceptance of AI-generated writing on fanfiction forums and about creators' anger at the continued scraping of existing fanfiction content by AI companies (Techcrunch) and by impatient fans craving more at a faster pace than human writers can provide (Rolling Stone) which has led to fanfiction creators to limit access to their writing.
								</p>

								<p>
									Now that these tools are widely available and already seeping into our avenues of culture creation and consumption, the question becomes one of discernment: How can we judge the quality, limits, and affordances of the outputs GenAI offers? As is often the case with GenAI art and writing, almost any output a non-expert user receives in response to a prompt is likely to leave them feeling astonished and a satisfied consumer of, e.g., instant poetry (Porter and Machery). However, experts who experience outputs in aggregate are more keenly aware of the limits and homogenizing properties of GenAI-made works. E.g., In late 2022, the editors of the science fiction magazine Clarksworld had to stop accepting submissions because of a flood of unoriginal and homogenous submissions rife with tropes of the genre, including more than 20 stories of the same title (The Verge).
								</p>

								<p>
									Further corroborating the divergent experience of a single work vs. the experience of GenAI-created works in aggregate is a study by Doshi and Hauser investigating the perceptions of short fiction written from AI-generated ideas. As the title of their study reveals, "Generative AI enhances individual creativity but reduces the collective diversity of novel content" (Doshi and Hauser). In other words, to understand the costs and limits of GenAI as a collaborator in storytelling and visualizing processes that redefine representation, it is vital to observe AI-generated content in aggregate.
								</p>

								<p>
									This project offers precisely that (among other things): By creating outputs related to a dataset of existing films, I aim to give users the opportunity to experience the limits of these systems' outputs in aggregate. And since recent and more popular Lesbian films, like The Favorite, Tár, and Carol, have entered something like mainstream film culture, it also stands to reason that readers would have familiarity with the material, a shared expertise, that will inform their evaluation of the GenAI's offerings.

										<h2>About This Project</h2>
									</header>
									<p>
										This project investigates how generative AI systems assemble, filter, and represent film data—specifically examining lesbian cinema as a case study. Through auditing GenAI outputs across multiple dimensions (text, images, metadata), we explore what gets included, excluded, and transformed in the process.
